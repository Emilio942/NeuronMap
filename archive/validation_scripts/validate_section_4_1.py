Section 4.1 Validation Script: Difficulty Assessment System
===========================================================

This script validates the implementation of the Difficulty Assessment System
for automatic question complexity analysis with comprehensive testing.

Test coverage:
- DifficultyAssessmentEngine functionality
- Linguistic complexity analysis
- Cognitive load assessment
- Semantic complexity evaluation
- 10-point difficulty scale validation
- Integration with question generation
- Performance benchmarks
